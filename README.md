# Modules-for-3Dslicer
My own modules for the 3Dslicer application

The modules can be interposed in slicer as follows:

1. Go to "Edit"
2. Select "Application Settings"
3. Go to "Modules"
4. There should be an option to Drag & Drop a folder/file from the explorer

Put all of your custom modules (.py files) into a folder and drag it into 3Dslicer. After that the selected path of the folder should be visible in the little window right next to the label: "Additional module paths".

After a restart the modules can be selected as normal in the dropdown which is located at the left side of the top bar (My modulses are located in the "custom" category)
